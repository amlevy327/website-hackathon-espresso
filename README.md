🤔 Inspiration

Inspired by CryptoZombies and Succinct Testnet to make onboarding faster and more fun

🧠 Concept

Espresso Stellar is an interactive, space-themed experience designed to educate developers and users on Espresso Confirmations.

Through a fun sci-fi narrative, players act as Pioneers navigating a galaxy of blockchains. Blockchains are Planets. Espresso Confirmations is the Warp Tunnel. Players are Pioneers.

Players experience the pain of traditional bridging (15-min delay) and feel the magic of Espresso’s fast confirmations by sending a payment on one chain and receiving an NFT on another chain.

💡 Why It Matters

- Espresso is invisible until you feel it. Espresso Stellar makes that moment tangible through gameplay.
- Try by learning: Users don’t just read about Espresso. They use it.

🧩 Composable Highlights

- Payment on Arbitrum Sepolia Nitro Rollup (Rollup 327327327)
- Espresso-enabled relay listens for payments to a specific wallet to trigger NFT mint
- NFT mint on Ethereum Sepolia (chosen to view NFT on OpenSea)

🌌 Future Expansion

- Add new missions for each rollup that adopts Espresso
- Chain stats, leaderboards, and explorer tools
- Build awareness: “Which chains support Espresso?”
- Expand beyond NFTs to other app flows
